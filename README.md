#bing-autosearch.js<br />

Motivation<br />
I mainly did this to practice javascript. I have experience in other languages but never have done JS. This is my first working script that is more complex than the noobie stuff. I also love the developer tools in Chrome so I made it compatible with devtools. 

Requirements<br />
If running from devtools, the only requirement would be Chrome itself. Also, an exception is needed because chrome blocks popups by default, so only one search will run at a time. 

Navigate in Chrome to: chrome://settings/content/popups<br />

add an exception for Bing and Microsoft sites<br />

Clone Repo<br />
git clone https://github.com/matts0613/bingAutosearch.js.git && cd bingAutosearch.js<br />

Usage<br />
I made this a snippet in the chrome developer tools
